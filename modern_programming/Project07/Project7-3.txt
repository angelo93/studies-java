The two browsers I used were FireFox Developer Edition and Microsoft Edge.
Between the two, Microsoft Edge displays the raw form of the JSON data.
However, there is no difference when viewing the actual webpage.
Additionally, FF displays the formatted JSON data due to its integrated
developer tools. However, the raw data form is available to look at.

All in all, there is only an aesthetic difference between the two.
The webpage is simply formatting the response wheras Microsoft Edge is not
when viewing the response directly.
